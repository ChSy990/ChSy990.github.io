                <p>This week is also a super busy and painful week, but I am used to it. I still have essential and complicated tasks this week, which requires me to arrange my time and energy fully. Following the advice, I divided this week's work into two parts, one is the mechanical part of RFID, and I plan to finish it by Wednesday. Because last week I successfully wrote the function and code part of Photon No.1 so that it can read the information in the tag and transfer it to the Particle Cloud. So this week, I focus on setting up Photon No.2 to work, allowing it to accept database commands and connect to the game. The most important part of the whole process is to replace the input keyboard (Korean keyboard) with different RFID tags. Another task is on the production of physical interaction devices. In addition to making the Korean block needed for the game, I also created some additional support materials (how to posters and brochures). In order to explain the project's inspiration to the public more clearly during the Exhibition, I made the Baby Print Model (small movable type simulation model).</p>
<p>I am very grateful to Eddy and Jack for their help in making RFID and technology production by Wednesday. Moreover, they help me to used the block made by MFD and the actual induction test in the workshop. Because I was very desperate at that time, I was afraid that I could not complete the entire prototype in a limited time. However, after this development process, I think it is imperative to use some hardware and sensor combination. Also, I realise that when you are experiencing difficulties and cannot solve it yourself, you should actively seek help. Although the process was challenging, I asked a lot of people questions during the development process and created some problems for them, but many students and tutor gave me much help.</p>
<p>I also found some errors in Korean wording during the hardware connection process. Because I was not involved in setting up statements and vocabulary work before, I did not find this problem in my previous work. I believe that different cultures and scripts should be respected when dealing with each country and language, so we need to carefully consider the Korean language used and the proper use of the text. If on the day of the exhibition, there are many Koreans or people who have studied Korean to visit or browse our concepts, and if they find mistakes, they will be embarrassed or think that we do not respect each other. Four of the vocabulary used in the six-game scenarios are wrong. After correcting the problem with the wrong word, I confirmed it again with Elliot Kim. My classmates are nice. Elliot replied to my message immediately at night and helped me confirm the sentences in the game. I list the whole work below, and I elaborate on each part in detail.</p>

<h2 id="check-the-equipment-list">Check the Equipment List</h2>
<p>I updated the contents of the Equipment list based on the items that will be used in the Exhibition. Because we need to simulate the scenes of the school classroom, I need more Setting Cube. It is also necessary to provide an extension cord for the power supply to help us use it. Lorna also helped me recheck the entire Equipment List and added items such as sandbags to help stabilise the Frame. I completed the contents of the Equipment List updated and checked before the final deadline.</p>

<h2 id="build-the-rfid-tech">Build the RFID tech</h2>
<p>This week I finished the production of the entire device and found the analog keyboard for the online Korean input method. So I set the input method in Unity to Korean, and the input is Korean when the RFID read the block tag.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q98fA3Z.png" alt=""><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xGhsOi1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>However, after the last week's test, my value returned a problem, and I cannot read the UID tag information from the Event. So I found the read code in the library connected to the RFID module and imported it into my project. Here is the minimum code to read the UID of each tag:<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OkqC87G.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Cloud Particle allows us to share data  <strong>Particle. Publish ()</strong> easily through its Console platform approach. After the release, I can see the Event and the amount of activity in the event section of the console <strong>interaction_value</strong>. At the same time, I set a function that converts the Int value to a String so that the format of the variable is uniform.</p>
<p>Then I can place multiple blocks on the Reader and slide them. It allows you to read the UID of the tag one by one and sort it in ascending order in the table. After this rather cumbersome task, I started to improve my code so that it only sends an event (a string array) when the Reader pastes a block.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NDgrTyR.png" alt=""><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xZJumDK.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And use the <strong>getEventStream()</strong> method for subscribing to the <strong>interaction</strong> events:<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/C0Ye0sY.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This process made me too painful.</p>
<h2 id="design-the-support-materials">Design the Support Materials</h2>
<p>Following the requirements, I designed a brochure for the product introduction. My team member Alan completed the text in the booklet, and we hope to describe more comprehensive information on a limited presentation page. At the same time, I am considering making a desktop artefact that can show us the source of inspiration. In this way, our team can also attract more people to the Exhibition.</p>

<h5 id="baby-print-model-for-explaining-the-inspiration">Baby Print Model [For explaining the inspiration]</h5>
<p>I designed a handmade product that contains all the Korean characters. I have designed this handmade product for two reasons. One is to show the inspiration to the public to the public, and the other is to let people play to achieve the purpose of attracting attention. People can move each piece of wood flexible and use any small piece of wood to form a piece of text. The top of each block is laser-lased with Korean characters. Moreover, each block is designed to grow into a cube, which is convenient for people to extract from the pallet.</p>

<h2 id="build-physical-material">Build Physical Material</h2>
<p>There are two main types of physical interaction materials, one is the wooden block used to slide on the shelf, and the other is The Baby Print Model. Based on the 900x600 MDF board, I made a laser cutting design of these two handmade products.</p>
<h5 id="korean-block">Korean Block</h5>
<p>In the Korean Block, the RFID Tag can be attached to the inside. After a simple test in the workshop(by Arduino board), the material and distance of this block can be used.</p>

<p>Based on the decomposition of the text used in the game last week, I made the characters that must be used in our game and the corresponding pronunciation. Moreover, assign these characters to be used to different blocks. In this way, the user does not need to use the same block again and perform a second scan. This kind of interaction process is more conducive to maintaining the cognitive process of the user to perform a single scan, which is beneficial to improving the user experience. All corresponding characters and assigned block pictures are as follows:</p>

<h5 id="the-baby-print-model">The Baby Print Model</h5>
<p>According to the design drawings, I divided the entire device into two parts. One part is a small wooden block of 24 cuboids, and the other part is a tray at the bottom, which can be placed obliquely. Through the 45-degree angle support frame, all the wooden blocks can slide down naturally. When people pull out the wooden blocks at the bottom, other wooden blocks can automatically slide down.<br>

<h2 id="prepared-the-delivery">Prepared the delivery</h2>
<p>On Sunday, I placed all the materials and items in the storage box and marked the Fluency mark. All of the fragile blocks and sharp objects are separate devices. I will be responsible for transporting our Frame at school on Monday morning.</p>
