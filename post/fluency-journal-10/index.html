                <p>On the morning of Tuesday, Our team did the presentation as the first group. I finished all the preparations for the presentation last week. However, because the cold has not recovered, the speech was delivered to Alan and Davis. In order to better provide viewers with the cognition and awareness of physical interaction prototypes, I produced a wooden block model on Monday night for the show on Monday. At the same time, in the production project, many device improvements in the physical interaction part are considered. These new ideas and design concepts will be recorded separately in another blog. After finding the right materials and installation methods, I will show them in detail and discuss the feasibility of the program with my teammates and tutor.</p>
<p>After the presentation, I used the smartphone to record the tutor's feedback and suggestions. Then they were independently organized into text manuscripts and then shared with the groupmates for discussion on Friday's class. In response to Lorna's suggestion, I also developed some new improvements after discussing with Lorna. Besides, I also communicated with Alan about new functional features for the animation design and technical aspects of the game. We hope to somehow connect the front-end design and back-end functionality of the game. Because this is not the same as the Front and End design of traditional web pages or other systems, the trigger mechanism and animation controller of the game are more complicated. For the physical part of the prototype, I decided to use MDF Board and WOOD TRANSFER after discussing with Jason. However, the specific details of this I still need to decide after learning the production tutorial, and I also need some materials to test Davis's RFID hardware. If the signal range of the RFID cannot penetrate the block material, then I also need to consider the 3D things.</p>

<h2 id="presentation-reflection">Presentation Reflection</h2>
<p>We know that the team presentation was only ten minutes, and I decided to provide printable posters and Brochures for each group and each tutor. In this way, we hope to provide more detailed project information to the audience to help the instructor understand the project in a specific way. In general, the presentation was a success, and all the content that needs to be explained was covered, and the slides I made provided sufficient information in a limited time. However, the physical prototype is fake, which is not up to standard. It is also a pity at this demonstration. Our team will focus on this part in the coming weeks.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/R6M5MhK.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>I also have many reasons for not completing the physical interaction within the specified time. Because the whole part needs Davis to complete, but I did not confirm the progress of the task before the team showed it, and the communication method was not efficient. At the same time, I thought that the wood blocks that were temporarily made the night before could be used as a substitute for a demonstration of the physical prototype. So there is no real test for the user after the demo. Our team lost a fair user test opportunity and lost a chance to get useful feedback.</p>
<h2 id="critique">Critique</h2>
<p>On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I also listened to other team presentations, some of which left a deep impression on me. The Gambit team's project is to help people who are sedentary in the office environment to provide rest opportunities. This type of user group needs to place &quot;AMICA&quot; on the desk and use lights to remind them to take a break or perform activities when needed. This is the team that I have been paying attention to since the beginning because their concepts are very close to the content of my thesis project, and I hope to get inspiration from their designs.</p>
<p>They have encountered problems similar to me if they keep users attractive and motivate them to continue to use them. Because the existing large number of reminder applications have the same problem, people are reluctant to choose to turn off or ignore these external prompts after hearing the alarm or message. So this requires designers to design and transform new features based on the environment in which they are used. First, they designed the entire device as an item on the desk and attracted the attention of the user through some attractive exterior shapes. At the same time, they also use a different colour to indicate the different states of the user. This is a great idea, and I think I can consider using a gradient light to remind the user of the current state of the body.</p>
<p>This inspiration comes from Zuckerberg's design that I saw in the news yesterday. The introduction of this product is shown in the video below. He is the &quot;sleep box&quot; designed for his wife. He created a wooden box that would shine, which would help his wife sleep better at night.</p>
<p>His wife, Priscilla Chan, after giving birth to two children, was not practical at night, and always worried that she would oversleep and miss the time to take care of her children in the morning, so she often woke up in the middle of the night to confirm the time and continue to sleep. Zuckerberg said that when her mother was tough because we had children, Priscilla could not sleep well all night. So specially designed a &quot;sleep box&quot; for his wife without time to help his wife adjust to sleep. When Zuckerberg designed the &quot;sleep box&quot;, he deliberately did not display the time on the box. He believes that seeing time often puts more pressure on people. If you wake up in the morning, look up at the sleep box, it shows that it is only 3 am, then you will subconsciously give yourself a psychological suggestion: OOOO~ I can only sleep for 3-4 hours, it is frustrating.</p>
<p>Moreover, this timeless reminder &quot;sleep box&quot; will send out a weak and glare-free light when the child wakes up from 6 am to 7 pm, reminding Priscilla that it is time to get up and take care of the child. However, the glimmer of the &quot;sleep box&quot; does not affect the Priscilla in his sleep. At other times, the &quot;sleep box&quot; will remain unlit.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-process-presentation-feedback">Working in Process: Presentation Feedback</h2>
<p>According to the recording, I will organize the suggestions and feedback collected in the demo into the following articles. Based on the feedback received by the team, we will continue to work hard and improve the project.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let the user put the block on the blank space of the sentence, which can strengthen the connection between the user and the system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way user can recognize they have put the wrong block. We do not think about it. The result will be shown when the user makes a word at the end, which means the user can only understand whether they make the wrong/right word during the process, and they even do not know which part they put the wrong block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The teacher assistant is a good idea and also recommend us to discuss with someone who has experience in this area (classroom technology).</p>
</li>
