<p>Work in progress: Background Research</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on the initial conceptual content of our team and the presentation tasks of the pitch, my primary mission is to conduct background research and case studies in the field of language learning. I have noticed that language learning is a vast field, and the existing research results are very complicated. After reading some literature and case studies, I found that if a subdivision direction is not determined in the field of language learning, the workload of the entire survey is enormous. Moreover, language learning is diverse, and different language systems need to achieve learning objectives according to different conditions. At the same time, I can't put forward a useful theoretical basis for a limited time and use it as a basis and guidance to support the future work of this project. This is a difficult decision. Therefore, after discussing with the team members, I decided to use the relevant technology of existing language learning as the main preliminary research direction. Because at this stage we need to consider the focus on proposing the new concept and broad research areas. The project needs to clarify and define the direction of in-depth exploration based on the feedback and opinions collected after the pitch.</p>
<p>All in all, in the process of people learning new languages ‚Äã‚Äãthrough existing technology, exploring their common ground is my focus area. Combined with another theme of the project: emotion, I decided to divide the background study into two parts. One research direction is Existing Technology, and the other is Emotion Design in the learning process.</p>
<h2 id="existing-technology">Existing Technology</h2>
<p>For this survey, I chose to research the major popular learning methods. Most people choose traditional teaching methods, such as following a teacher in a classroom or learning a new language through reading and training. HoweverÔºåthere are also some people who are willing to try to use new technologies to learn new languages, such as the popular new learning methods of apps, websites and Augmented Reality that beginners, which freshman are willing to use.</p>
<h3 id="application">üì±Application</h3>
<p>After the survey, these the language learning apps are popular with users: <strong>Duolingo</strong>, <strong>Rosetta</strong>, and <strong>Busuu</strong>. These learning programs have a common point that the user can directly skip the translation of the intermediate language and directly touch the original meaning of the word as a beginner. The main studying method is that the user understands the meaning of the vocabulary or sentence by guessing the sense of the picture. Another form of the learning process is designed as a form of a game level tour, which is suitable for users who are used to learning words and basics in all areas of first learning. To sum up, this kind of app is easy to learn, suitable for beginners of foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äã(primarily the first self-study of the second foreign language), ideal for quickly grasping the everyday language. But it is not suitable for further improvement of intermediate scholars. The main reason is that the app on the portable device cannot provide the user with a systematic language learning foundation.</p>
<p>However, this type of learning has apparent limitations. Joey J. Lee, director of the Columbia Research Lab at Columbia University, studied 50 language apps in 2016. He said that the real lack of most apps is &quot;application.&quot; He explained: &quot;It is important to learn the language of the language application environment, and this is something the app can't do.&quot;The application can help users to speak in a specific situation and let users reach the level of speaking as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Tom Roeper, a professor of language acquisition, said that language apps are unlikely to quickly find ways to replace the two primary strengths of human faculty ‚Äì the ability to attract students‚Äô attention and to continually adjust the curriculum based on individual progress, difficulties and interests. Ability. ‚ÄúThere are a variety of contextual factors to consider in language learning,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to do both with the language app.‚Äù In future research, I need to consider to select one of the app downloads and experience its features in depth based on the primary research directions.</p>
<h3 id="website">üñ•Website</h3>
<p>The most significant advantage of the Internet is to break the geographical and time constraints. The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãonline language learning is the right combination of this advantage with foreign language learning. First of all, for those language learners with limited time (for example, professionals), a large number of language learning apps allow them to use the loose time for language learning. Secondly, students can communicate directly with foreign teachers and receive feedback promptly by using the online platform(such as <strong>Busuu</strong>,<strong>italki</strong>Ôºå<strong>Khan Academy</strong>), which is very conducive to oral learning. Most importantly, many online learning sites try to add a variety of activities to the classroom arrangement. For example: learning a foreign language by listening to a song, learning a foreign language by watching a movie. These activities mobilise a variety of sensory channels such as sight and hearing, activate the whole brain. This can make the user learn a foreign language more efficient.</p>
<p>After all, online English learning relies on the network so there will be many temptations in the process of using the Internet. Especially for those younger learners, the purpose of education is not clear, curiosity is powerful, it is easy to neglect to learn because of other fun things. At the same time, for procedural online learning sites, curriculum design and traditional education are similar. Therefore, it is not possible to adjust the curriculum on time according to the learner's own study level, which is too rigid and stable and lacks autonomy. And the online courses offered by foreign teachers have exposed many problems in the process of teaching. First of all, the level and ability of teachers are mixed, which makes it difficult for students to choose. Second, many teachers are trying to attract students. The pursuit of novel and fun teaching effects, the introduction of a large number of stories or simple activities, but neglected the teaching of crucial knowledge points. Users can be attracted to interesting course content, and the learning process is spent happily, but there are very few knowledge points that can be truly understood.</p>
<h3 id="interactive-whiteboards">üìãInteractive whiteboards</h3>
<p>This is a Multiplayer collaboration platform(such as <strong>Explain Everything</strong>). This approach allows users to use the tablet to learn the language and experience two distinct advantages: One is to maintain a manageable record of all conversations with native speakers and to store it as an electronic file. The other is that the tablet can make notes that can be used quickly so that users can revisit what they have learned in the future. At the same time, the convenience of the tablet also provides the possibility for the user to use multiple software at the same time. Advocating scribbling on a tablet in opposition to mechanical typing. Using the empty record can extend the visual contents of the project with useful audio cues or additional resources. The visual sensory design based on this can fully mobilize the user's attention and participation.</p>
<h3 id="augmented-reality">üì¶Augmented Reality</h3>
<p>This is a new way of learning and is based on the development of technology. Users can interact with gesture recognition or speech recognition and learning content and promote interest in education (such as <strong>Mondly AR</strong>). Help people are discovering the fields of chemistry subjects, people can combine multiple elements with seeing how they act in reality. Once the user scans the application of the printed target, the 3D model of the human body will display. The user may interact with the 3d model As well.</p>
<h2 id="emotion-design">Emotion Design</h2>
<p>When using the product, the user has the opportunity to experience a variety of emotions. For example, they can get inspiration from the aesthetic look of a mobile phone, feel happy with new toys, be content with the high-quality sound of a music player, or be satisfied with the sound of an alarm clock. Different triggering conditions evoke these emotions, and they also differ in their behaviour and attitudes. Besides, positive feelings relieve stress and reduce the harmful effects of negative emotions. Thus, while we are considering how to combine physical props with emotion design, we can deliberately design products to elicit different and predefined positive emotions. In this way, the user is encouraged to support the use of products. For example, products that evoke happy emotions can stimulate new interactions, and products that generate interest can stimulate user-focused and exploratory interactions, and products that evoke user satisfaction can encourage peace and reflection.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that how learners attribute their performance influences not only their self-efficacy, motivation, and goal attainment but also their emotions. The motivation to insist on learning the language is the biggest problem faced by those who try to learn a language themselves. When they lose patience or learn motivation is weakened, they are more likely to have negative emotions that are tired of learning.<br>
Besides, as Nakamura and Sachiko said that the Enjoyment was an emotion the most frequently mentioned by both groups while other emotions, such as joy, happiness, and disappointment, were expressed only by the beginner learners. As the current research shows, providing a good learning experience and making students feel happy and enjoyable is just as important as equipment. They use new L2 knowledge or exam strategies to increase motivation and improve attitudes, and in turn, assist them in further developing the second language.</p>
<h2 id="future-research">Future Research</h2>
<p>I plan to explore new interactions and learning experiences based on the target user after getting feedback and suggestions. And hope to get a more clearly defined research goal after pitch.</p>
