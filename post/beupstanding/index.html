Course: Design Computing Studio 3 - Build</p>
<p>‚ÄúBeAppStanding‚Äù is an iOS mobile application to further help the target users to sit less and stand more. This application and physical prototype were development by using native platforms (Swift,Xcode). The key component of my responsibility is to consider how to enhance the user experience and design the data visualisation by using emotion design and interface usability. In terms of it, the system can improve the cognition of target audience.</p>

<h2 id="design-goals">Design Goals</h2>
<p>BeAppStanding is the project initiated by Professor Genevieve Healy from the Public Health School at the University of Queensland. Professor Healy and her colleagues have created the BeUpStanding project in order to raise people‚Äôs awareness of sit less and stand more. This project, BeAppStanding, was created as the extension of the Be Up Standing project, the goal of this project is to create an iOS mobile application to further help the target users to sit less and stand more.</p>
<p>The solution for the project was to develop an iOS mobile application, the critical features of this application are ‚ÄúPersonal Activity Goal‚Äù and ‚ÄúTeam Activity Goal‚Äù. The application allows users to create the standing activity goal by setting how many times they want to stand up and the interval during a day, then the application will remind users to stand up and complete a set of activity by sending them a notification. In addition, users of the application are allowed to invite their friends or colleagues to form into an activity group and the team leader can create a team activity goal for each team member to complete, this feature was designed to encourage users to complete more activity goal.</p>
<p>By the end of this project, our team completed and provided a working application which can meet current requirements from product owner. The main features of the application have all been successfully deployed to the final product, main features including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign up and login</li>
<li>Personal Activity Goal</li>
<li>Team Activity Goals</li>
<li>Activity Goal Data Visualisation for both personal and team‚Äì Pending Tree</li>
<li>Account Management</li>
<li>Award System</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="user-context-research">User Context Research</h2>
<p>In this project, the target is to design an iOS mobile application which is able to assist and encourage users with monitoring their daily stand up tasks by setting activity goal individually. Notification function which is one of the key designs of the BeAppStanding application to remind users of doing tasks in time. In addition, users are allowed perform team activity by forming a group. Team activity goal can be set by the team leader who creates the team. This unique design can greatly enhances user experience by allowing users to do activities with friends or colleagues. In the design process, we focus on convenience and interaction. All the main functions are deigned to put in ToDo page altogether which is easy to maintain and viewed by users. Design of Done page enables users to view their daily activity within 12 month calendar. Initially, only white, blue and red colours are used in the user interface because we considered that office workers prefer clearer and simpler visual feelings than complex design. However as the colour purple has been considered strongly related to the image of UQ, thus the UI design was re-designed so that users can see purple elements in some areas which aims to fit with UQ style. shows the changes of UI design.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="3"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tDx3f9Z.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>I got the feedback of adding gamification elements to the data visualization in our application after first critique. We recognized that the advice is very valuable for the application so that after confirming with our client, we decided to use animated falling leaves from tree to replace the visualised data in the application. This tree was named ‚ÄòPending Tree‚Äô. Animated falling leaves from tree enable users to interact with data more directly with better understanding of operational standing activities and users‚Äô own completion status. It changes the previous design of visualised data that which was not interactive enough. Previous design is shown in below.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="4"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/20qvXHB.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>The visualaztion tree will initially have 9 leaves, and keep current state if user keep finishing all the tasks every day. If user did not complete all the tasks in a day, tree will lose leaves. The leaves will grow back when user finish all the set plan in three days. The core design of this part improved the conventional sport Apps which are in lack of amusement elements, difficult to maintain and these functions motivate users to do activities continuously. In the design process, we selected big palm tree with green leaves as the symbol image. Palm tree grows in warm and coastal places which suits the image of Queensland‚Äôs warm and sunny weather. Green always represent refreshment which is the core concept of this application. Animated design was used to model the real tree, if user did not give them enough nutrition and water the leaves will fall. I applied this concept to our application that if user did not complete the tasks, leaves will fall however if user finish the tasks (give them enough nutrition and water) the leaves will growing back.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-encounter-scenario">The First Encounter Scenario</h2>
<p>For this scenario, I can simulate how someone is first introduced to your system, finds or purchases it, installs/opens it for the first time, and learns through use what it is for and how it works.</p>
<h2 id="the-fringe-scenario">The Fringe Scenario</h2>
<p>For this scenario, I can identify possible scenarios of use or misuse that push the limits of your system. It is about use cases that arise in ordinary (but atypical) circumstances that pose issues for the idealised use/functionality out team have implemented.</p>
<h2 id="style-design">Style Design</h2>
<p>Icon of our application is also one of the important design parts. I redesign twice during the development process. Concepts like high-recognizable, high-resolution, visual consistent are applied in our deign. In the previous design we choose to use green or orange for the icon however I consider that purple is more fitted with UQ style, thus ultimate UQ‚Äôs symbol colour purple was selected to fill the most parts of the icon.<br>

<h2 id="thanks-for-all-my-teammates">Thanks for all my teammates:</h2>
<p>I designed and implemented the Medium-fidelity to High-fidelity prototype of the application independently using Adobe suit and conducted conceptual model based on user testing. Additionally, I learnt how to use the Swift to build an IOS application by using the Xcode. As the only people in the team responsible for experiencing design and interface design, you guys have given me a lot of practical opportunities. I am very happy to work with you on this project, and in the process I have experienced the complete project development process. Throughout the project development process, the lessons I have learned are not available in other courses and theoretical knowledge.</p>
