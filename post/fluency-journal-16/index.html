                <p>I think that even if you have not experienced some work and things, you should try and work hard to complete. Even if you cannot get the work done, you can ask for help or try it again. Instead of just giving up a choice at the beginning of the semester, or imposing all work on other teammates, just because you had no prior experience in doing it. If you have never used these tools or experienced things with your own hands, you should enter into 207 and try it instead of avoiding the practice work.</p>
<p>This week is extremely hectic. At the weekend, I completed the production of Physical Building and RFID and tested and installed each of the inside Tag in the Block. However, the RFID prototype which I made was an alternative plan for our project to prevent accidents. Because we still have hard to communicate and understand the progress of our team members, we don't know the completed level and work process of RFID and how it works as the original plan in our team members side. Thus, Alison and I decided to try our best to complete the entire project. Clay also helped us to solder all the female-to-female extensions and install them through the hardware to ensure that the entire wire section is usable. Eddy also provided enough wires to our teams.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also prepared an extension cable of the Power Bank to ensure that all Micro-controllers have a stable power supply. Because other team members have things, only me and Alison will do all the work of Setup and the assembly of the Frame on Monday. However, I think it's indispensable to conduct actual tests at The Edge, so I took the time to persuade other team members to take time off to the location for testing on Monday. The facts also prove that all actions are meaningful. Because of our testing on Monday, there were problems with our gaming systems and hardware devices. I know that Tuesday morning has also been in a state of repair. Alan once thought that our team could not run the program, so it has been unfortunate.</p>

<h2 id="exhibition-setup">Exhibition Setup</h2>
<p>On Monday morning, I packed all the materials and useful items into the car according to the list of equipment list prepared the night before. However, because of Van's shipping space limitations, I need to disassemble the Frame. To avoid the difficulty of assembling in The Edge, I renumbered each part of the Frame and marked the connector and screw position.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fDEGmhn.jpg?1" alt=""></figure>
<p>According to my original layout plan, the venue was arranged on Monday morning. However, we have overlooked an important thing, the A3 guide poster. So I rushed back to school to print immediately on Monday afternoon and returned to Workshop to check the items needed for our project. The whole process is very tight. Fortunately, The edge staff provided enough Setting Cubes and Equipment for us to place in the exhibition location. The power and circuit components throughout the location also met my previous expectations. I placed all the essential circuits behind and used Frame as a bracket to hide the wires. At this time, I understood why we had to visit The Edge at the beginning and know the power location and essential devices. In the practice of the exhibition, it is necessary to check the use of the location in advance.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="2"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jtla8UG.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>The entire Setup process is significant and valuable, and it provides relevant experience for our activities in the future or related projects. For example, I prepared the equipment and items before the equipment was moved and checked the list of items and site inspection during the preparation process. Moreover, throughout the handling process, I need to wrap the sharp objects to avoid them from harming the transporter. During the entire transportation process, it is necessary to cooperate with teammates to complete the confirmation. In the process of Setup, it is necessary to protect the facilities and floors of the site, and so on. These seemingly small and straightforward experiences will be of great help to my future life and real life. I am very grateful to Lorna for the opportunity to exercise this time.</p>
<h2 id="exhibition-experience">Exhibition experience</h2>
<p>At the official exhibition, we smoothly arranged the scene into the classroom scene, as shown below. The public can sit in a chair at any time and listen to the teacher to explain the content of language learning. According to the previous tutor's suggestion, our game needs to play the pronunciation of the vocabulary during the learning process, and use the background music to guide the user to learn. So Alan and I added background music and effects music to the game. The background music selects a relatively cheerful rhythm, and the effect of music is used to prompt the user whether the spelling is incorrect. If the word spelled by the user is correct, the game will sound a &quot;correct&quot; tone. Conversely, if the user's spelling is wrong, in addition to the game interface displaying a red &quot;cross&quot;, the corresponding beep can also appear. So I am going to have my Bluetooth stereo, I can connect directly to the computer on the same day, and I can save the wires.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the number of visitors was relatively small, but we still collected a lot of useful suggestions. Alison and Matt taught us how to better communicate with the public and suggested that we make the vocabulary used in the game bigger to increase its visibility. At the same time, in order to enhance the user's vocabulary memory, we can add a visual cheat sheet next to the Frame. In this way, users can see the words they need to build while sliding the Block. So I immediately drew a visual cheat sheet of the game vocabulary based on the User Guide. Although very simple and rough, it played a significant role in the later display.</p>

<p>I am very happy that the Baby Print Model, which I made, has been welcomed by the public. After explaining the experience of our group project to some students who visited and experienced in advance, I think the Baby Print Model is essential. Because the team's overall project is very complicated, we can't explain it to all visitors in the shortest possible time. Coupled with the experience time, most people still can not understand the meaning of the entire design. So I changed the explanation strategy. I suggested my teammates use the Baby Print Model to tell the public about the source of inspiration for this concept. We first need to inform the user that multiple blocks can be combined into words by the combination of characters so that they can enhance the memory of learning. Then we use the baby block with Korean characters to show the public how to use the game block. Because the baby block is tiny and flexible, it can be used by everyone. Finally, guide the public to the Setting cube (the area of ​​the simulated classroom) and start learning.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="3"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dqnsJRC.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>Based on this display rule, our team explained the project and design very clearly and can make the public (students or public) without background knowledge understand the meaning of our project.</p>
<h2 id="after-exhibition">After Exhibition</h2>
<p>Because of all the physical equipment, I prepared at the beginning, and I still need to sort all the items at the end. I once again break the Frame into a transportable state and load the auxiliary items into the Box. Small objects such as screws, etc., I use a sealed bag. I hope to keep all the items I use and return them to the school entirely. If you use something that is not your own or borrows something from someone else, you need to return it altogether. This is our responsibility and obligation. Besides, I think that many items can be recycled by future courses, just like the frames and fabrics we use. This is also a way to save money.</p>

<h2 id="the-reflection-of-exhibition">The Reflection of Exhibition</h2>
<p>In this exhibition, we have received useful feedback from different publics and can use this as a basis to improve our prototypes and provide users with a more friendly way of interacting. Throughout the process, there have been many emergencies we assumed earlier. There have also been some things that I didn't expect. For example, I don't know that some of the game's features have been deleted or a lot of Korean error have appeared in sentences. The entire test process validated my hypothesis. Most people can not understand and read the sentences displayed in the game throughout the process. It is complicated for participants to understand and remember the characters in the vocabulary. During the limited time of the visit, people could not identify a word that they had never seen before.</p>
<p>Aliosn，Alan and I have suggested to change the Korean sentence to vocabulary in the game interface during the concept design or to display the English explanation in the game interface. Because the user is a beginner of language, it is impossible to read and understand Chinese sentences without learning first characters and vocabulary. For example, if we have not studied &quot;ABCDE&quot;, we will not recognize the words &quot;Mom&quot; and &quot;Dad&quot;. We are even less able to understand and say the sentence &quot;she is my mom.&quot; The tutor also mentioned these questions and suggestions. Unfortunately, our suggestions and recommendations are difficult to adopt. This problem has caused us to spend more time explaining the meaning of all sentences to the public during the exhibition. This is why I have to increase the use of a visual cheat sheet later.</p>
<p>One of the most important recommendations we got was to focus our production on the Block. We can use different colours to distinguish between characters and pronunciation parts on different sides of the Block because our prototype requires the user to use the face of the pronunciation part towards the RFID Reader. Through the colour marking of different faces, the user can quickly understand the difference between pronunciation and characters.</p>
<p>Another suggestion came from Jason, who suggested that we could add feedback to every Block that was used correctly. When the user picks a block, the entire Block can prompt the user for the correctness of the selection through music or vibration. For example, if the user selects the correct Block, the Block will display green. Conversely, if the user selects the wrong Block, the Block will show red or vibrate. Through this search experience, users can quickly and know their choices.</p>
<p>I am delighted that some people like the things which I made, and I realize that I can make something useful to people. The prototype has human value and has the opportunity to be applied in the education industry(such as language school). From inspiration to concepts, from ideas in the brain to physical devices, there is much experience in the whole process. I can make sketches drawn in the Ipad into something that can be used in the real world. This process gives me a sense of accomplishment. I am very fortunate to study Interaction Design and study this course.</p>
