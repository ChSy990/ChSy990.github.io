                <p>Yes, I won the 'most posts' and 'You done good' awards of 2019. Thanks for Lorna and all the tutors who appreciated my works even though they were not perfect haha.</p>
<p>This is my first completely developed physical computing interaction project. The whole process was very complicated and torturous, but in the process, I recorded the process of each work step. In this journal, there are a lot of drafts and inspirations that I conducted in the design thinking process.</p>

<p>To be honest, DECO7385 was one of the most challenging DECO course in my university life. This is because it was a 4-unit(double of general course) course which expects you to spend a lot more hours than the other course, and also I only had limited experience with physical building/computing. Throughout the course, I realized how helpless I am whenever I had difficulties cutting the steel plate and understanding the mechanism behind technologies I have never heard of (e.g. RFID and ESP32). And I think our team had much more difficulties compared to other teams as most of our teammates were not familiar with physical builds and programming.</p>
<p>From this course, I definitely think that I could improve my design skills and tangible prototype develope skills, as we were keep upgrading/fixing our ideas and seek advices from tutors and experts. In terms of graphic design, it was a great experience of sharing ideas and advices with other team member. And I also have enough time and chance to try different hardware and tools.</p>
<p>I could also learn and practice some physical building skills, which makes me confident of hand-crafting. I can make things by my hand. I am still not confident working with codes and programs however now I feel much confident working/understanding the mechanism of electronic platforms including Arduinos, Neopixels and ESP32. Connecting different cables to different ports/devices were challenging but it was great to explore digital prototypes other than Makey Makey.</p>
<p>By doing the weekly stand-ups, I think I become much more responsible of my task and project, it was such good pressure to force myself to work on &amp; acheive SOMETHING to impress my teams and tutors. What I feel upset about this semester is that I could not be as productive in some weeks because of my health. Since I am diagnosed with gastritis and irritable bowel syndrome this year, I had to do some procedures and testings, which limited my performance for some days. The last stage was definitely the worst time for me.</p>
<p>The best part of this course is that we get an opportunity to present our project to our friends, families and professionals in the industry. Even though our team had some issues at the exhibition, it was still an amazing experience to introduce what I have done for this 3 months and talk to people I may not have seen.</p>
<p>If I get an opportunity to do another physical computing project in future, I want to do a project on learning through play, because they looked so much engaging and fun compared to other projects in the exhibition. In conclusion, DECO 7385 is not an easy course and I still have some assessments to work (haha) on but these definitely worth to improve myself as a designer and get an opportunity to do an exhibition.</p>
