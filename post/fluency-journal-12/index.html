                <p>This week our team finally got progress in the game program, and Alan and I finally completed the basic game design in Unity. In the end, the game flow in Unity was basically achieved. On the weekend, I started to work hard to realize the transition of the game from 2D project to 3D project. There are still a lot of tasks and work to be done this week, and the last two weeks remaining, I need to do all the work faster. Personally, I have completed new animation effects in the design and production of game characters and explored the use of RFID in the use of prototypes. Because according to the current progress, I am anxious about the technical part of the RFID of this project. The most important part of our project is the game program and RFID, which can cause severe problems if one part is missing. So, another important task for me this week is to prepare an alternative. I am familiar with Arduino and Particle Photon, so I will learn how to use RFID and set up Reder and Tag this weekend.</p>
<p>Similarly, I am also interested in the application of RFID. It is also very interesting to learn new hardware knowledge. I think this technology also can be helpful to know the Internet of Things and Game Design in the future.</p>
<p>Besides, I am also looking for suitable physical materials to make physical props, and I hope to find an appropriate way of interaction. I hope I can find and design more suitable display methods and physical objects for this project, which can provide users with a better interactive experience and clear cognition.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-process-build-the-mode-character-swimming-animation">Working in Process: Build the mode - Character Swimming Animation</h2>
<p>Fortunately, I basically mastered the way to make basic animations in Blender, and I have built the skeleton of animated characters. Therefore, I still follow the direction of designing walking animation, first observe the posture and movement process of the character swimming, and make an action decomposition diagram. This useful action is more difficult and complicated than before, but I can do it through a detailed swimming process decomposition diagram.</p>

</ul>
<p>After the animation design is completed, the fdx format file is also packaged and exported in the same way as the texted skin file. I import the package file into Unity's asset and debug the controller.</p>

<h2 id="the-physical-block-discussion">The Physical Block Discussion</h2>
<p>The tags in the block can be divided into low frequency and high frequency using two different RF types. Our team needs to decide which way to use and how to install it into the block. Among them, low frequency (LF) tags have longer wavelengths and can penetrate thin metal materials more effectively. However, low-frequency RFID systems have a limited reading range of only a few centimetres or a few inches. Some common examples are access control systems and animal tags. High-frequency (HF) tags are suitable for reconnaissance of metal objects, and can also solve goods and medium water content. Typically, high-frequency RFID systems have a read range of a few inches, but can also have a maximum read range of approximately three feet (1 meter). For example, high-frequency RFID applications can track library books.</p>
<p>I also had a conversation with Alison about this problem, she and Jason both suggested that our team can consider buying some toy blocks or plastic cubes that have already been made instead of laser-cut boards. This is a really excellent and useful way to help us fix the core issue. We can't delay the next stage of work because of the uncertainty of RFID, I think I need to consider the replacement plan and try to solve it. This really urgent. Because this method can become faster and more cost effective. At the same time, this small box toy uses PVC plastic, which is also a viable material we tested before. Also, we can design blocks for each face, which may be faster and easier to implement the physical interaction part of the device. So I will go to Kmart and BigW with Alison or some other place to find some suitable blocks and start designing and building blocks.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-process-issues-4">Working in Process - Issues 4</h2>
<p>I need to focus on these issues below before the next week and continue to work on the next step.</p>
<h5 id="how-to-choose-a-suitable-rfid-frequency-for-the-game-application">How to Choose a suitable RFID frequency for the game application</h5>
<p>At the same time, it is similar to the radio, it must be adjusted to a specific frequency to hear different channels, and the RFID tag and reader should be tuned to the same frequency to communicate. There are three general types of RFID frequencies: low frequency (LF), 125 – 134 kHz; high frequency (HF), 13.56 MHz; ultra-high frequency (UHF), 433 and 860-960 MHz. We need to consider the scope of installation of concrete interaction equipment. Moreover, device size, if using low-frequency wavelengths, it is more difficult to use in Edge. This situation is very prone to problems that users cannot use blocks or texts that are unrecognizable, and it is easy to reduce the user's experience.</p>
<p>We have not been aware of the implementation progress and feedback results of RFID functions until now, so we cannot choose materials and blocks according to the specific size of the micro-controller. At the same time, we cannot continue to design the layout in The Edge's booth, because we cannot judge the actual range and distance that RFID can radiate.</p>
<h5 id="how-many-interface-should-be-used-in-each-block">How many interface should be used in each block</h5>
<p>I need to calculate how many squares each vocabulary needs to use and make sure that each vocabulary has enough squares to be used. And, within the effective use of RFID. At the same time, how to make the block more readable and Korean recognition is also a problem. I compared the Korean text structure, the exploded view is as follows, so I will find the right materials based on these two structures.</p>

<h2 id="next-plan">Next Plan</h2>
<ol>
<li>Alison and I will go to Kmart and BigW or Officework to explore new block materials（plastic materials）on weekends. I hope we can find the right size and inner hollow block toy so that we can bring it back and make it.</li>
<li>I will count all game vocabulary and the amount of text used. Choose the right way to add pronunciation and Korean to the box. And design the flat content of each square.</li>
<li>I hope that I can find the right block material or have a better alternative this weekend. This will prepare the design of the installation and physical prototype before the next week's meeting.<br>
4.Initial experimentation with the use of RFID to complete the alternative plan.</li>
