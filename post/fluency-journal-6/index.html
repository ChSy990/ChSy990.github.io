                <h2 id="the-edge-visiting">The Edge visiting</h2>
<p>On Tuesday morning, our team visited The Edge, the location of the final project exhibition.</p>
<p>This is a great creative space, where the staff gave us a detailed introduction to the necessary equipment. At the same time, he also introduced how the past exhibitions worked and all the resources and space they could provide. Moreover, asked us about the unique requirements we need to see to see if they can help us. Later, he led us to a professional production lab and explained how to use various equipment. I used to work in nearby museums and libraries, but I never found this mysterious little space by the river. The Edge contains a lot of original equipment and tool materials, as well as a computer lab and expensive design software that you can use for free.</p>

<p>We also visited the studio, which contains a series of materials that we can use to create the physical objects needed for the project. Since our project is a scene-based language learning system, it requires a screen and a protector to display the scene, and then the user can use the block to interact with it and learn Korean. After discussion, our team thought that one of the projector brackets mentioned was suitable for our project. Using the projection bracket can effectively save our project space. In this way, we don't need to use an oversized screen or a big display to display the system interface.  Besides, the projection device can also be adjusted according to the actual display area, which is also conducive to the consideration and design of our physical interaction prototype.</p>
<h2 id="discuss-the-project">Discuss the Project</h2>
<p>In the team discussion, I proposed a program to increase user guidance. According to the display steps of the system, the user needs to place the correct block at a specific location.  At the same time, these blocks need to be arranged according to specific rules, and the system will allow the user to see the movement of the characters and check if they are correct words.  However, when new users are ignorant of the system, they may not understand the correct way to interact with the system. Besides, overly complex systems can also cause users to fear and refuse to participate in the game. So in this week's discussion, I proposed a plan to build a user guide designed to help users use the system and get a better gaming experience. We can use a large screen or player to show the entire game flow. Alternatively, when the user first uses the system, in different positions of the game interface, prompt statements appear to help them make the correct action.</p>
<p>For the part of the physical interaction prototype in an exhibition, I got a new inspiration after discussing with Alison. I will review the information and share it in the blog.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-process-build-the-mode-character-textingrigging">Working in Process: Build the mode - Character  Texting/Rigging</h2>
<p>Personally, I have been working on Character texting and rigging in Blender. In the process of colouring the characters, I need to mesh all the characters' appearances according to the modelling of last week. Then I stretched each piece of the gridded model into a flat shape. Colour each skin with Adobe PS. Finally, I import the new skin file into Blender and skin the character model. I followed the tutorial instructions to adjust the colour of some of the exteriors during the final colouring phase. In the later stages, depending on the scenario, I will adjust some of the appearances to create more different game characters.</p>

<p>To give the game characters more opportunities and movements, I need to continue to make the character's rigging, to create different angles of action and action. In the process of making character rigging, I need a more detailed tutorial, because it involves more people's skeleton and activity details. Therefore, the shortcuts and tools used in this production process are more complicated. So in this process, I tested my patience very much. My learning method is to play the video tutorial at a slow speed of 0.5 times to ensure that I can learn every step of the way. In Rigging, the character needs to set the active skeleton from the middle of the body torso. In this way, every part of the body is connected to the joint. In this way, I can set every movement of the character's activity. For example, I can adjust the range and angle of the arm so that I can set different actions in different keyframes during post-production animation. However, the difficulty in rigging design is how to set the human body joints in the right position. If the length of the characters and hands in the game is different, it will be very embarrassing.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-process-build-the-mode-issues-1">Working in Process: Build the mode - issues 1</h2>
<p>Our team has many problems in the process of importing files. One problem is that some versions of Blender production files cannot be successfully imported into Unity. Another problem is that the imported files will cause data missing, which may cause some details to be displayed. On Friday, our entire team is working hard to solve this problem. However, there are still some version issues that cannot be resolved. The team plans to discuss with Steven whether this problem can be solved, or we need to find other ways to model it. Fortunately, my role import is successful and can be displayed completely. However, whether I can handle importunity successfully after texting and rigging, I need to test it in the next group meeting.</p>
<h2 id="next-plan">Next Plan</h2>
<p>The next important step is to add the character I made to the walking action and make the walking process an animation. This is another new round of challenges for me. I used to think that the character modelling of the game is very beautiful, the operation process and the fighting action are very cool. However, never realised that behind every game character, it takes a lot of time and effort from the designer to make every action. The seemingly simple character walking animation also needs constant adjustment and optimisation in the computer software. I am more and more enjoying the production process of this course, which is also the opportunity for me to contact the production of game characters.</p>
