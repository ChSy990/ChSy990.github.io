<p>Working in Process: Physical Prototype New Idea</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After visiting Edge, I was thinking about how to install our equipment in a limited space. Because of the exhibition, there will be many groups and devices, and the staff will be crowded. We need to consider how to make better use of the limited exhibition area. At the same time, we also need to provide users with an ample range of activities. As I saw each area separated by walls, I suddenly thought that our physical concept design could make use of these walls. Not only can we save on display space, but we can also use existing walls as part of our physical installation. In the staff's explanation, he mentioned that a specific carpet could be laid. This is also a very coincidental reminder of the new way I design user guidelines. I describe these two new concepts in detail below. Because of the materials and block devices involved in RFID, we still need more consideration and production. I will have more discussions and material selections with my teammates about the entire physical device.</p>

<h2 id="inspiration-the-movable-type">Inspiration - The Movable type</h2>
<p>Movable type is the system of printing and typography that uses movable components to reproduce the elements of a document (usually individual letters or punctuation) [1]. The first known movable type system for printing was made of ceramic materials and created in China around AD 1040 by Bi Sheng. Like below:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mr7NSQX.jpg" alt=""><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PoHufwp.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Movable type inspired me. In the making process of the movable type, people use small squares and engrave a single text on each small square. After being arranged and combined in a particular order, complete words and sentences can be formed. If the number of small squares increases, you can arrange them into a complete article. The substantial prototype part of our concept also can use small squares instead of text. Therefore, I envision that perhaps in our project, you can use small squares instead of different texts in Korean. In the process of the game, the user is guided to select different squares and form the text by the way.</p>
<h2 id="the-concept-description-the-physical-interaction-prototype">The concept description - The physical interaction prototype</h2>
<p>We can create different Korean letters on different small squares. These different small squares are combined into letters and vocabulary in order by different arrangements and combinations. At the same time, the user's entire combination of actions will be carried out on one wall. I think that in this way, the user can experience the fun of the game through the interactive activities of &quot;find&quot; - &quot;select&quot; - &quot;grab&quot; - &quot;combination&quot;. Because of this process, users can use their vision to identify different Korean letters while using both hands to perform patchwork. This is also beneficial for beginners of language to learn and recognise the composition of the Korean language.</p>
<p>The complete experience is as follows:<br>
When the user walks in front of the wall, they can see that there are many small squares with Korean letters on the wall. These small squares can be flexibly grabbed and moved on the wall at any time. When the user starts the game, they need to follow the guidance and prompts to select some small squares into a specific Korean vocabulary within the specified time. The steps of the whole box are all done on the wall.</p>
<p>The equipment sketches are as follows:</p>

<figure data-type="image" tabindex="2"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sbyaY9b.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<h2 id="the-concept-description-the-user-guidance-design">The concept description - The user guidance design</h2>
<p>The entire project is divided into physical interaction parts and digital interaction parts, each of which requires a detailed explanation. At the same time, the entire project will use more equipment. The control steps become more complicated. So, I think it's essential to add user guidance settings during the initial phase of the user experience. Besides, I also consider that users need to keep the game experience fresh when they first contact the system. If the whole game experience process is too long, it will reduce the user's experience. Through user guidance, the user can know which specific device to go to and use for each step. By matching the operation guidelines, the user's cognitive ability and operation ability can be improved.</p>
<p>The complete experience is as follows:<br>
The complete user guide is divided into three sections, the beginning of the animated video introduction, the middle carpet digital guide and the game use tips. In the beginning, the user will first understand the entire game content and basic rules by watching the introduction video. The user can then follow the numbers and arrows on the carpet and walk to the similar device for activity. Finally, they can see the necessary prompts in the game interface.</p>
<p>The equipment sketches is as follows:</p>

<h2 id="the-potential-method">The potential method</h2>
<p>After describing the two design concepts mentioned above, I suddenly came up with a new idea. If I reverse the steps of the entire game's operation project, what effect will it produce? The result is that users will experience different games. The particular concept is described as follows:<br>
The user first selects a few interesting ones from a pile of squares engraved with Korean letters and puts them on the wall. If the order and structure of the blocks are incorrect, the system will sound a beep. At the same time, the characters on the game screen will remain motionless. When the user's block combination is correct, the system will sound different prompts, and the corresponding game screen will display similar words and sentences. In the game screen, the game character will move and play the animation in the corresponding scene.</p>
<p>The user goes to use different squares to piece together the text randomly. This is independent creative gameplay that also belongs to an open-end interaction. In this way, users can explore the combined structure of Korean by themselves. The system only needs to judge whether this combination is correct and give guidance when appropriate.</p>
