<p>Discussion of Potential Methods</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the contact session this week, our team further refined the concept of design based on the comments and feedback collected. In last week's study of target users (beginners), I also found some existing problems and limitations of the original concept. So in this week's contact, I raised my questions and further elaborated the reasons, and discussed the solution with the team members and the new direction of development. At the same time, Alison and I proposed new inspiration and conceptual design based on the results of the relevant background survey, combined with the project theme. We hope that new concepts can be used to solve the existing problems and defects so that the whole language learning process is more playable and participatory so that users can more be immersed in the system itself and therefore, have a more effective learning experience. To this end, I have conducted further studies on interaction method and Intent Experience Comparison, to obtain Insights from them to help us further enhancement of the idea.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="refined-concept">Refined Concept</h2>
<p>In the original concept, there are many problems. One of the main components of the project is the Language Learning. For this, we have done some research. We have found-relying on/Getty Images and animations to attract users ' attention are becoming less important currently. They have been hard to attract users to keep motivated to learn, new languages. Maybe Some interact tools can help to fix this problem. For example, we want to design a glove-represents the user's heart rate by the LED light changing. If the sentences appear is too difficult for the user, the user would feel nervous, and their heart rate is accelerated. The speed of the glove's light would be. At the same time, the system can switch to another new Sentence.</p>
<p>In previous discussions, we re-examined the different comments and feedback, based on the results of the study to test and change the following points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the target user clear as a beginner. In the original concept, our target group is young people who love to learn the language. However, this kind of user positioning is too broad, so according to the suggestion, we define the target audience as the beginner of the word. It also helps us to further identify user group image and conceptual needs in future research.</li>
<li>The physical interaction section increases the use of blocks (a cube with six polygons). Block-based interactions can be more productive and provide users with potentially creative space.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="working-in-process-interaction-method-research">Working in process : Interaction Method Research</h2>
<p>Through plenty of interaction methods of language learning analytic research, we know that in the tractional classroom-based foreign language learning process, the Initiation–Response–Feedback (IRF) is the default Interactional practice for all curricular areas (Hall, 2010). This study provides each of the three sequence actions experienced by learners in the course of language learning and the microscopic interaction details. This continuous interactive learning approach involves a range of cognitive abilities and motivational tendencies while explaining the communicative actions in a variety of learning modes, namely gestures, gaze, face, and other language channels. Because through these methods, the user can personally participate in the language learning process and the use of body language and language (difficult to exist entities, need to exist in the way of literal expression) interaction. The equivalent of the user can use the real limb to deduce text learning. This behaviour makes their cognitive ability further deepened, and provides a rich interactive channel for the language and the learner.</p>
<p>In the same way, in the process of second foreign language learning, it is necessary to add the traditional interaction method appropriately. For beginners, the use of physical objects can better attract their attention in the learning process (Hall, 2010; Huggins et al., 2016). The interaction of language learning process with an augmented reality(AR) has a positive effect (Cheng, K.-H., &amp; Tsai, C.-C., 2016 ). In the process of language learning, the use of AR different interaction mode can bring users a positive learning experience, and further improve the user's learning motivation. The direction we need to consider is how to combine the unique advantages of new technologies with the content of traditional interactions to deliver a better user experience for beginners.</p>

<h2 id="potential-methods">Potential Methods</h2>
<p>Our group takes the beginners of the second foreign language as the primary research object and analyses the background research of the second foreign language and the related theories in the field of language learning. In response to the research results, we propose the following insights:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The concept needs to make rational use of the interactive functions and features of the platform, focusing on improving the listening and speaking skills of beginners;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept emphasises the promotion of the learning platform and the reasonable expectations of beginners while meeting the individual needs of learners;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept needs to optimise the mobile platform configuration of the learning platform to improve the user experience of beginners comprehensively;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emphasis on cultivating beginners' network self-learning ability and improving user network learning efficiency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect feedback on the use of learners promptly and establish an excellent interactive relationship;</p>
</li>
</ol>
