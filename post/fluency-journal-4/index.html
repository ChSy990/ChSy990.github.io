                <p>In Tuesday's class, we summarised what the team did last week and the results of the study, and explained how it would proceed to the next step.  After we saw the countdown displayed on the classroom whiteboard, we decided to start the process of speeding up the project.  In my sharing phase, I explained the results of last week's work, such as how to rely on AR to make games and to make target users feel fun in language learning. At the beginning of the project, I never considered designing and producing a project on language learning in this course.  I used to think that under the premise of language learning, it was difficult for me and Alison to find a breakthrough in making users feel fun.</p>
<p>How to add emotional design to language learning and make the whole process interesting is something we have always had a hard time deciding. Therefore, we have spent a long time in the investigation and research.  Fortunately, we have completed the initial phase of the study and presented the findings that support our project (can see my previous blog for details). This week, our team discussed specific project implementation scenarios and the necessary elements to start creating prototypes. I started learning about 3D modelling and animation that I have never touched this week, and I also tried to create simple scenes and characters in the game.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="refine-the-concept">Refine the concept</h2>
<p>We have conducted several considerations and investigations on practical concepts. The initial idea was to have each block scanned and placed by the user in order. After talking with the tutor, she mentioned that this might not be the best user experience. The level of this concept is limited to games, without the theme of the emotional design. I think if it's just a game, the user won't participate and choose it because his game content is language learning. Relative to the type of language learning that is similar to close games, users are more inclined to choose more easy-to-story and adventurous games in a limited time.  In response to this, I reviewed Low-Ploy's solution after reviewing the games and styles that I have experienced on different platforms.  The concept was inspired by the games I played - “Everything&quot; and “Mountain”. Both of these genius games are designed with Low poly, and the game's graphics are very appealing and give a healing feel. I hope that through this simple picture and bright colours, I can reduce the irritability of the user's language learning. Moreover, guide them to explore new scenes through clearly identifiable character and object design in the game screen. At the same time, I proposed a plan that hopes to increase user guidance experience.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-process-game-design-discussion">Working in Process: Game Design Discussion</h2>
<p>After the team discussion, my task with Alison was to create some scenarios for our target users to feel that they were in an immersive environment and help them remember that they need to learn.  According to the mode of the game experience, I proposed different game types and gave an implementation that combines concept.</p>
<p>After discussing and sharing opinions, we intend to create a system scene in the style of Low-Poly. We have never learned related skills before, so after simply browsing some low-poly information, we decided to work together. Alison started searching for some related tutorials on YouTube to learn how to create low poly scenes. I started searching for relevant styles of game design resources and the process content of the game. There are a lot of excellent game content and modes, which I think is very useful.</p>
<p>Moreover, these games also use an open ending and experience.  So I decided to experience the most representative games in low-poly, such as &quot;Everything&quot; I mentioned.  In this game, players can look at the world from different perspectives by simulating everything, and use different postures to feel the different landscapes that exist in the corners of the heavens and the earth.  The game's interface first originates from a spot of light, then slowly grows and shines.  As the light increases, everything in the game interface begins to clear, and the protagonist is a creature on earth. Slowly, the player has a specific form, and with thinking, began to embark on an adventure. On the journey, users can talk to any species, think about many problems, and explore slowly in this world. Players can also switch back and forth between any species to see the world from a different perspective. I think this way of simulating everything is very new and chic and thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Here are also some very stylized works — for example, the mountains and water created by designer Timothy J. Reynolds. This very stylized low-poly art is often seen in some indie games, such as the one below.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="2"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VcAa2YM.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>Paper Fox is one such example. The paper model in the game gives a refined sense of novelty. This is a fun and educational software developed for children. The scenes and characters are utterly low-profile style designed by designer Jeremy Kool. It vividly simulates the wrinkle of the thin origami at the edge and looks very good. Outstanding. The style of paper is not the only choice for low-poly art, and more popular games have chosen a more colourful and more rounded art style.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="3"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/URTTovQ.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>The immersive scenes in this game can make the user and the game interface more intimate. Moreover, they can talk and learn with the system while exploring the entire map.  I will discuss this user flow and experience design ideas with my teammates on Friday's workshop. Due to time constraints, we may only be able to complete limited scene settings, which will be the critical issue we need to solve.</p>
<h2 id="working-in-process-build-the-mode-character-creating-modelling">Working in Process: Build the mode - Character  Creating/ Modelling</h2>
<p>Since Alan and Davies will focus on most of the technical aspects of the system to support our project, their main production tool is Unity, so we decided to use &quot;blender&quot; to model the scene and design the characters. This is another tool that can help me create low poly style scenes, and files in the blender can also be imported into unity.  Since the team has proposed two scenarios about the waterfront, the scene should include beaches and oceans (water and sand materials), and I also began to learn how to use this production software by making simple scenes. I spent much time with Alison this week to learn the basic operations of Blender, such as lighting and rendering.</p>

<p>The modelling I am mainly responsible for is the modelling and animation effects of 3D characters, and there are fewer related tutorials.  Besides, I need to create different character movements according to different scenes, such as walking and running, swimming, etc., which is another difficulty.  This week, according to the tutorial, I completed the modelling of the characters from the hands and feet of the characters. There are many unskilled shortcuts and field of view adjustments throughout the operation. The process of learning is not natural, but I will try my best to create animated characters that can walk and show the whole prototype.</p>

<h2 id="next-plan">Next Plan</h2>
<p>In Friday's workshop, our team identified all the scenes and environments included in the game, and next week I will discuss with Alison the actions that each scene needs.<br>
Another most essential task next week is to add colour and styling to my character model and try to make an animation of walking.</p>
