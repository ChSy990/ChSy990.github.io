Course: Human-Computer Interaction</p>
<p>“Spoon Pets” is a conceptual interaction design of an application prototype that helps users develop productivity and overcome procrastination, therefore enables them to foster ethical behaviour. Spoon Pets is a mobile app that overcomes procrastination by allowing users to effectively manage their schedules and facilitating their use of the Pomodoro Technique to limit the use of mobile phones during their mission. Users can earn points by using the Pomodoro timer to complete tasks that can be used to raise virtual mobile pets. Whenever the points reach a certain amount, the app can donate a certain amount to non-profit organizations, allowing users to help stray animals in entertainment. The prototype was built by using Adobe suit and sketch.</p>

<h2 id="context-research">Context Research</h2>
<p>With the goal of “behavioural change”, our project has chosen to focus on “procrastination”, a problem that plagues many people. To understand the procrastination, we conducted a literature study and conducted a questionnaire survey with students from the University of Queensland. This provides us with a deeper understanding of the causes and generality of procrastination. At the same time, we examined some existing products on the market and found that the tomato work method is a relatively sophisticated and productive working method. With the use of task planning and visualization data, the Pomodoro Technique can achieve good time management results.</p>

<h2 id="scenario-user-research">Scenario &amp; User Research</h2>
<p>In order to understand the needs of the target users, we conducted a situational interview(open-end questions) with some students and professionals. We analyzed the collected interview data by subject analysis and analyzed the observation records with the affinity map. As a result, we have gained initial insights into the way users learn and work, and the need for users to improve time management.</p>

<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p>According to the user's requirements, we determined that the platform of the system is mobile, and I further developed the user requirements into preliminary system requirements. Next, we analyzed the stakeholders and users, conceived the design within the group, and sketched the mobile application. I summed up our design results and built a conceptual model that served as the basis for our subsequent prototyping and iteration.</p>

<li>Low Fidelity Protytpe（Paper Prototype）</li>
<li>Medium Fidelity Protytpe（Digital Prototype）</li>
<li>High Fidelity Protytpe（Digital Prototype）</li>
</ul>
<p>I created a basic paper prototype to demonstrate system functionality for collecting initial feedback from the user on the system and expected functionality in user testing. This user test uses questionnaires to obtain quantitative user experience data, and through interviews and observations to understand the user's perceptions, expectations and confusion about each function. User feedback helped us refine system functionality, allowing us to increase system availability and ease of use in iterations.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="4"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2w8FZbM.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>In the Milestone 2, I iteratively designed the mid-fidelity prototype with an inkjet knife, adding some details of the time management functions and the basic layout of the interface. The second user test focused on two main functions of time management, collecting feedback on navigation, usability, and interface design. This test allowed us to discover the user's improper use of the function in time to optimize the function and interaction design.<br>

<p>The high-fidelity prototype was produced by Adobe XD and is the deliverable of the project. This prototype embodies the interface design style we expect and the more detailed functional usage details. The prototype went through an iteration after usability evaluation. Our summary UX assessment results show that the current design has been able to better meet the user's needs for the user experience.<br>

<h2 id="usability-evaluation-ux-evaluation">Usability Evaluation &amp; UX Evaluation</h2>
<p>Usability assessments are used to iterate high-fidelity prototypes using both heuristics, cognitive process walkthroughs, and system availability scales. The UX assessment is used for a summary evaluation of the project's results. We first analyzed the user research data, came up with five UX targets, and then selected two of them for testing. The results show that our deliverables have reached the desired target level on both selected UX targets.<br>
