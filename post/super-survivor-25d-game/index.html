<p>“Super Survivor Game” is a small map adventure game of website. It was built by using the HTML5 Creation Engine(PixiJS) and involve some form of physical interaction by using the MakeyMakey. Using the statement provided to my game by the Game Generator at http://orteil.dashnet.org/gamegen.</p>
<p>The protagonist of the game is a different kind of small box, the player needs to manipulate the small red box to move and avoid multiple small black boxes of attack. At the same time, players need to control the little red box to find a symbol of the “survival package” of the yellow box and carry a small yellow box to move. Within the specified time, when the player places the yellow box in the correct position of the map, they need to collide with the little black box. Then, the movement of the small black box group can be stopped immediately. Finally, the player wins the game.</p>

<p>I built a video prototype to test the implementation of an idea. And also produce a video that communicates my concept for the game.<br>

<h2 id="the-concept-prototype-video">The Concept Prototype Video</h2>
<p>I introduced my idea in the form of a film, showed it at the seminar and collected feedback from the viewers. Participant feedback shows that this game concept can appeal to players. But they expect to have more features and more interaction with game elements and characters to meet their needs for challenge and participation.</p>

<h2 id="prototype-2">Prototype 2</h2>
<p>I created an interactive prototype of my application interface that considers the critical user functions, tasks and/or interactions. I was aiming to implement a complete or polished interface. At this stage, I drew a task flow diagram and based on it, I created an interactive digital prototype using JavaScript and PixiJS, showing rough game interface elements and gameplay. In the user test, I asked the participants to complete the game task and then collect their opinions.</p>
<p>The results show that the gameplay and interface are very easy to understand, but there are some usability issues and the gameplay needs to be improved. The functionality should be completed to a level that allows for a clear understanding of the elements being evaluated. Thus, when I was deciding on the aspect to be prototyped, consider what it is, I want to know about how people would engage/interact with the game interface. According to this, I also created multiple prototypes to evaluate variations in functionality, task flow and interaction methods. As this is an early prototype, the design of the interface used placeholder and wireframe graphics to represent interface elements.</p>

<h2 id="prototype-3">Prototype 3</h2>
<p>After adding the task system and difficulty to my original design, I improved the task flow chart and digital prototype, and made a game control device with Makey Makey combined with cardboard to complete the somatosensory interactive prototype. This prototype is primarily used to test the usability and user experience of somatosensory interaction design, as well as new game features. User test results indicate that the player is interested in the expected somatosensory interaction, but the accuracy and ease of use of the interaction can affect the gaming experience. On the other hand, the increasingly complex task flow also brings confusion and obstacles to new players.</p>
<p>I developed a prototype to evaluate the intended physical (non-digital) inputs/outputs of my game application. The key issues what I am thinking about are the physical interactions should be appropriate to the game concept. And it should be prototyped to a standard that allows for useful evaluation. Another problem I need to address - which is the intended physical interaction of my game. In this process, I want to test the physical interaction/input method separate to the interface. And I also want to check how that physical input is represented back to the user through the interface.</p>

<h2 id="prototype-4">Prototype 4</h2>
<p>Since the player reflects more usability issues on the previous prototype, I developed the second interactive prototypes as the primary test target. User test results show that the new interface is easy to understand and helps the player to play smoothly, but the somatosensory interaction is somewhat difficult due to the number of objects that need to be manipulated. Therefore, future improvements will consider the integration of telescope-like tools and operating blocks into new control devices.</p>
<p>In the last step, I also did the Dark-horse prototype. Because I felt that my concept is suffering from a lack of inspiration. Maybe it can provide some excellent idea for me to refine my game according to the feedback. And, through this test, I can know how the user interacts with the physical prototype under extreme conditions. At the same time, this also helps me to design the fault tolerance mechanism of this game.</p>
