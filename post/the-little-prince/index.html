Course: Introduction to Web Design</p>
<p>The Little Prince is an interactive story website for children aged 13 and under. The project aims to design a digital version of a printed “choose users own adventure” book. The entire website was designed through three iterations process to explore how it can most effectively translate the book from physical to digital form.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what is &quot;The Little Prince&quot;<br>
The website is basing on a household French story- The Little Prince. A poetic tale with watercolour illustrations, this story contains several fantastic adventure experience of the little prince. The little prince, the pilot and the narrator are brought to a desert due to a crashed aircraft, which makes a beginning of the story.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p><a href="">Process</a></p>
<h2 id="user-research-persona">User Research &amp; Persona</h2>
<p>The project required the selection of an entity children's storybook to be adapted into an interactive website. I started with the characteristics of the user, checked the children's reading habits and related literature, and then selected the story of &lt; Little Prince &gt;. The story of the Little Prince has all kinds of decorative elements which can attract children. These elements can satisfy children's curiosity and also provide precious design materials for the website. Since children are challenging to reach and communicate directly as a vulnerable group, I determined the scope of the target audience. According to the insights of the reader's feedback, I made two personas. The user-centred design of feature based on this research and data.</p>
<h2 id="information-architecture">Information Architecture</h2>
<ul>
<li>Site Map (describe the navigation)</li>
<li>Card Sorting</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the content of the website mainly revolves around the story of the Little Prince, the information contained is limited. Therefore, I disperse the content of the website into cards. It can help me to define several categories, and then let the participants perform closed card sorting activities to determine the website's information structure. The event mainly found the problem of column division and naming. Next, I painted the improved website content structure into a site map.</p>
<h2 id="visual-organisation-research-accessibility-research">Visual Organisation Research &amp; Accessibility Research</h2>
<ul>
<li>Website Functionality</li>
<li>Key Task Flows (it can contributes to user engagement with the story)</li>
</ul>
<p>I designed the page layout based on the content of the site and plotted the wireframe with Balsamiq. Among them, I added a start page to match the atmosphere of the story and adjusted the layout of the story column to improve the reading experience. On this basis, I designed the interactive gamification function of the story column intending to attract children. Then, I drew two wireframe flow charts, which are the task flow of browsing the website and reading the story.</p>
<h2 id="paper-prototype">Paper Prototype</h2>
<ul>
<li>Test(Walk through method &amp; observation)</li>
<li>Problem : hard to recognize the words</li>
</ul>
<p>I made a paper prototype based on the wireframe and task flow diagram and conducted user testing. This test led me to find that the name of the column containing the word &quot;Little Prince&quot; still confuses children who have not touched this character. Moreover, it made me aware of some usability issues with site navigation and functionality. I iterated the interface and functional design based on these feedbacks.</p>
<h2 id="design-specification">Design Specification</h2>
<ul>
<li>Visual Aesthetic</li>
<li>Design Mockup</li>
</ul>
<p>I further improved the visual design of the website. Since most of the image material used by the website comes from an illustration of a physical storybook, I first considered the style of the illustration. Moreover, I created the same style of illustrations by hand, and incorporated more elements related to the story. These work helped me to create a visual effect that is consistent in style and echoes the plot of the story. I have summarized the design specifications for my design and plotted the demo with Figma.</p>
<h2 id="high-fidelity-user-testing-web-development">High Fidelity User Testing &amp; Web Development</h2>
<p>I used HTML and CSS to complete the central static part of the site and tested it as a high-fidelity prototype. In this test, I got much positive feedback on visual design. At the same time, this feedback also reflects the optimization of the web site's navigation and function within the story. These feedbacks let me know what users expect from seeing more interactions within site. Based on the test results, I finally iterated the design and completed the website development.</p>
