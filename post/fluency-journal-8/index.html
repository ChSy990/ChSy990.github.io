                <p>At this week's group meeting, we first reported on the progress and completion of individual tasks, including the issues that need to be addressed. The overall concept of the project has not changed much, and every member of the team is working on the task as planned and maintains close contact and content review. Besides, the new physical interaction prototype ideas I proposed were also discussed with Tutor this week and discussed between the groups.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="discuss-the-project">Discuss the Project</h2>
<p>Regarding the discussion of this project, the problem of property loss still missing after the scene modelling import program is still not fixed. So, how to import Blender files into Unity and ensure that colours and other assets are not lost is still the most problem we need to solve. If the background is not built successfully, the backend development of the entire game environment cannot continue. On this issue, we concentrated on consulting tutor and agreed to discuss this Thursday. If this problem cannot be resolved, we will discuss the remedies and alternative plan immediately.</p>
<p>We conducted the first detailed discussion on the prototyping part of the physical interaction. Because according to the original plan, we mainly use the scanning interaction supported by RFID technology. However, now that we decide to use blocks, we will be able to create more possibilities. The first part is about material selection. According to my original design, the block is magnetically sucked on the wall. However, Alison suggested that I consider using &quot;Velcro&quot;. This is an excellent suggestion, because the block on which the sensor is attached is cumbersome, and the velcro makes the weight of the entire block lighter. This also helps users to use and move positions flexibly.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Afbqdyo.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>However, the RFID devices that our team ordered now are not yet available. Moreover, we need to make many user tests after making the prototype. The project needs to improve the whole physical interaction part based on the results of useful feedback. We will continue to refine this idea in the mid-break.</p>
<h2 id="working-in-process-build-the-mode-character-walking">Working in Process: Build the mode - Character Walking</h2>
<p>Personally, I finally completed the first animation of character modelling this week. I finished the character's walking animation and gradually began to experiment with more behavioural animations. When making the walking animation, I refer to the movement posture and movement changes of the person, and first design the movement decomposition diagram of the character skeleton.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="2"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xHWaMCw.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>A simple walking process can divide about five movements and changes. I mainly adjust from the swing changes of character’s feet and hands to simulate the figure of the character walking. Now I have mastered the skills of making different and adjusting the skeleton movements of the character model, and I hope that I can do my best to help the team complete the project.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-process-build-the-mode-issues-2">Working in Process: Build the mode - issues 2</h2>
<p>In this week's modelling process, I have two problems. One problem is that skin files cannot be used during the walking animation of the software. In other words, the character model I am making now is a walking nude character. The entire animation interface looks very stupid. Another issue is how to import animation effects into unity and let the user control. For the first question, I consulted the tutor on Wednesday. He instructed me to import the animation file and the texting file into unity asset and skinning them separately. This is an excellent way not to affect the original project files, but I need time to try and wait for the system rendering effect. Another way is to recreate the animation of walking. That is, I need to continue building the model skeleton and making animations in the same file from the beginning of skin production. Throughout the process, I have to complete all the designs without interruption.</p>

<p>According to the information and tutorials I have queried, after making the animation, I still need to continue using code skills in unity to set the movement and scope of the character. This is also my biggest challenge in the rest of the week.</p>
<h2 id="next-plan">Next Plan</h2>
<p>I will continue to try two different fixes to make the characters use texting while walking. Moreover, according to different game scenarios, prepare the motion movements that need to be designed. Besides, I will use unity for backend programming of game characters. In this way, the action of the character is set to trigger behaviour and functionality.</p>
