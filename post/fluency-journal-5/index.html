<p>Working in process: Additional Research</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the project of our group, we have refined the concept based on the proposed insights. However, according to the content of the concept, our team still needs to develop the appropriate interaction method for the implementation plan further and matching electronic technology. I want to use this as a basis to learn more about physical interactions and to understand how interactions are applied in augmented reality. Because I have never considered design-related language learning or learning-related design, and AR's interaction design is an area I have never touched, so this is the practice I need to do more research and new software.</p>
<p>Among them, our team needs to use some physical technology to interact in a specific scenario physically. However, this is the first time I've considered designing interactions in AR, and I don't have much knowledge of how to interact in an augmented reality environment, and it's hard to make recommendations and designs for the team. So, I decided to research this particular area. Other than that, as Alan said, &quot;the new concept still uses the unique physical props but should now be more engaging and playful.&quot; So this week my survey focused on solving this problem. To achieve the goal, our team is ready to motivate users to learn the language through the game, but there are still many problems to be solved in the process. At the same time, in the course of the underlying investigation, I also learned that most people still have a strange feeling about augmented reality technology. How to improve their ease of use and usability in the experience will also be my problem. Therefore, my research work at this stage is mainly divided into the following aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>User learning costs in AR design</li>
<li>Interaction in Video Game</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="user-learning-costs-in-ar-design">User learning costs in AR design</h2>
<p>Although AR and artificial intelligence are not new topics in the computer field, in the field of user experience design, how to combine the two is still a new direction to be explored. <em>Augmented reality (AR)</em> is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real-world are &quot;augmented&quot; by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory, and olfactory [5].</p>
<p>Because in the past we have been studying how to interact or visually interact in a plane.   Most people (mainly young people) can use an ordinary smartphone without any explanation, whether it is Huawei or Apple, IOS or Android. That's because we've already known the smartphone model. In other words, today's smartphones are designed based on a standard model. This standard mode is a generation of hypothetical verification from the functional machine. The result of the process validation.</p>
<p>Moreover, further, although it can be used, switching to Apple and Android phones can feel different. Users who are accustomed to using Android phones to use Apple phones and users who are accustomed to using Apple phones to use Android phones can feel uncomfortable. However, when users use a typical product of augmented reality technology: AR glasses, how long it takes to develop their habits without any instructions. This is what I think of the cost of learning, how to motivate users to learn to use it when they first come into contact with augmented reality.</p>
<p>Through research [1][2], the psychological process that occurs when a novice wears AR glasses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Well, I saw from the glasses that I didn't have the glasses in my environment&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, I saw (interface)&quot;<br>
&quot;What do you do?&quot;<br>
&quot;There is a cursor&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, these are clickable.&quot;<br>
&quot;How do I click?&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the user's heuristics are broken here; they will ask for help. Alternatively, look at the instructions, and when they understand how the clicks are entered, the heuristics will continue. From the methods as mentioned earlier of using vocal thinking, we can easily conclude that the input method of wearing the AR device is an obstacle for the user to establish a new cognitive system. From this point of view, we will most likely need to add the original user guide on the interface of the fault just now, or only add the remote control (accepted experience) for input and control. This is the primary way to reduce the cognitive barriers of users. The AR ecological environment is a new ecological environment [3] in which virtual images are superimposed on the real environment. Anything the user knows about it, in addition to inheriting their own experience of using a mobile phone or computer, will inherit their original knowledge of the real environment. The real environment of people is a three-dimensional, physical world, which affects the user's motion or static judgment of the virtual image, distance judgment, and context judgment. If these judgments in the AR ecosystem are contrary to people's real (physical) world, it will cause difficulties for users to establish cognition.</p>
<p>In the follow-up study, I need to determine how to make the target users (beginners) of our project adapt to the new ecological environment as soon as possible, and use specific tools or functions to accomplish the goal of language learning.</p>
<h2 id="interaction-design-in-video-game">Interaction Design in Video Game</h2>
<p>Based on the concept of our project, our team hopes to guide users to learn the language through the game. So what I need to consider is how to reduce the cognitive barriers that users can make throughout the process and improve their motivation through emotional design. The first problem is that we need to make beginners learn to play this game and like it. The second question is how to design a user experience and a series of studies in the game. Although I have played many games and I am designing indie games with my friends, there are still many problems when thinking about the problems in this direction. Fortunately, this Tuesday night, I had the opportunity to participate in the Glenn Veugen speaker's &quot;UX design at video game studio&quot; activities. He served Freelance UX designer in my super-favourite game <Horizon Zero Dawn> in. This game is super great and has a very high score in IGN. I am very excited with my friends and want to sign the first time. Again, this game is an open world game, which is very similar to our project theme &quot;open-end&quot;. I am very interested in learning about the work and contributions of UX in the game design process.</p>
<p>According to Glenn's introduction, I also learned in detail how UX plays and works in the entire game design process. This is an excellent job. At the same time, he also shared his own design experience and research methods. Application software, websites, and games are the three main categories of interaction design. The basic principles of interaction design are the same. However, the game is different from the other two types. <em>Players don't have a particular goal to play games. The fundamental purpose of playing games is to experience fun, and the focus of interaction design is how to help users get the fun of the game.</em> The contextual design that <em>&quot;creates a sense of substitution and the sense of fluidity&quot;</em> and operation that creates the game are at the heart of the process experience.</p>
<p>The situational design doesn't just look more interesting, and it also helps users get into an imaginary space. This kind of space usually needs some elements in the game to help form the &quot;imaginary world&quot;, so the game itself's gameplay and function are harmoniously and vividly combined with the scene, which can help the player to form a sense of substitution and play more games. For example, by combining functions and scenarios, or using game scenarios to influence the user's immersive, realistic experience. Generally speaking, the software or website does not give users time limit or pressure. After completing a task, the user can proceed to the next task autonomously. However, the game is just the opposite. The release of stress and pressure is an excellent source of fun, creating a sense of fluidity and control that allows players to focus more on the stress of the game, the continuous, cyclical experience of fun. For example, a game in a short game usually expects the player to play the next game quickly, so do not pop up a large and complicated settlement panel to cause a substantial interruption. Reduce the number of interruptions in the game and reduce their interruption perception, making them think that the game has the pleasure of sustainable operation.</p>
<p>What I should think about is how to incorporate these experiences and improvements into the group's projects, how to make our projects bring more learning experiences to users, rather than just being a game.</p>
