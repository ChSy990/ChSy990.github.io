<p>Working in Process: Final Physical Prototype</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first physical interaction was to require the user to place the square on a blank wall and then observe the animation on the screen. Use a nylon clasp on the block to hang on the wall. The idea was based on The Edge's window bay. I also completed the location design in The Edge in the last few weeks and made a live view. And I selected the location in the window bay. So I always thought that I would use the projection I saw during the visit, which was suspended from the roof. So when people stand in front of the projection screen, they do not use obstacles.<br>
Moreover, the display of low poly games will be great. However, I do not know why our team suddenly changed to a rear projection and a Frame. It may be that we missed important information, Alison, Alan and I were surprised and scared when we knew it. This means that the Location and Physical Installation method, which I originally designed requires a considerable change. The original design of my interaction is shown in the figure below.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/A2VESMo.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>We decided to decide to install the Frame and the rear projection firstly, and the start to think about the new solution. Alison(my teammate) was too nervous and worried about this part and dry overnight. She decided to talk with tutors and tried to catch up. At the same time, I decided to come up with at least two different physical interaction plan and installation scenarios based on the new Frame and the rear projection. Finally, Alison and I discuss the new solution based on the detail information we got. Alan focuses on game development in Unity, but the font section needs attention. Time is very tight, and I need to come up with new ways of interacting in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we obtain the installation instructions of Frame. I also successfully designed two options in advance. Through discussions with Lorna, we plan to create a container into which RFID will be placed. In this way, the user can play the game directly while placing the block. Lorna suggested that I use a bookshelf or similar item and place the container on it, then the user can place the block on the container and slide directly over to play. I will describe each part of the design in detail below.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-concept-description-the-physical-interaction-prototype">The concept description - The physical interaction prototype</h2>
<p>The game is projected onto a frame fabric which also holds a shelf. After scanning the blocks, users will slide them onto the shelf in the correct configuration depending on the language. This process is tracked by the teacher and will help students understand the physical structure of the words.</p>
<h2 id="the-inspiration">The Inspiration</h2>
<p>My design inspiration still stems from ancient Chinese invention - movable type printing. In ancient times, people used movable wooden blocks to combine them in different order and structure to form text and print. I learned the structure of the text from an early age, and learning how to write the text is also done according to different structures and sequences.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="2"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/By9K3ci.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>So I looked for some Korean language learning materials and text structure and began to observe the combined structure of the text. I found that in Korean, the text structure can be divided into four types (as shown below). Each text can be broken down into different parts. Use up to three sections, which can be composed of a specific horizontal or vertical arrangement.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="3"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jX9ZS9s.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>Then I print a part on each side of the block, and the user can use a few blocks to form a complete text pattern.</p>
<h2 id="the-frame-part">The Frame Part</h2>
<p>We initially had difficulty building the Frame, and the entire device lost some of the brackets and adapters, so when we laid the Lycra material, the entire Frame was easily tilted to the front. However, Lorna helped us find the most reliable way to install. I followed the instructions to install two support rods on the bottom to increase the bottom weight and smoothness. Through the entire installation process, I know that I need to go to the gym. I need muscle and power.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QJ8ip6u.jpg" alt=""><br>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3zONjSV.jpg" alt=""><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PrgCk4C.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>According to the design, we need to install the shelf in the appropriate position in the Frame, so I measured the size of the entire Frame, including the size of each bracket and adapter. At the same time, according to the size of the block, I calculated the size and material that the shelf needs. I hope that I can reserve enough distance to place more blocks for the user by ensuring the stability of the shelf. The design draft below：</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eEQBRh2.png" alt=""><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Dsp5qaf.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I finally cut the board and successfully built it in the middle of the shelf.</p>
<h2 id="the-block-part">The Block Part</h2>
<p>I placed the block purchased by Alison on the shelf for observation and thought about the final display. If I can print the Korean part on the surface with a surface sticker or a laser cutting method, the effect will be better.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dZS4Zpi.jpg" alt=""><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fXFyTwl.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I use the square to simulate the face of the block and break down the text that will be used in the game scene. Then gradually assign each part to the square. In this way, I can know the order in which the user uses the squares in the game. Each square also represents the input key of the Korean computer keyboard. For example, in the English keyboard, we usually use the &quot;V&quot; button, which is &quot;ᄎ&quot; in the Korean keyboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IW4Ajs4.png" alt=""><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z7xigDN.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This means that the face of each block(one Korean part ) represents a button on an English keyboard. So I will disassemble each of the Korean characters that will be used, and record the keyboard key symbols and input order for each part. This can be provided directly to Alan to help him set the conditions at the back end of the game.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="4"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZOJfa6b.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>Each block I designed contains three letters. The opposite of each letter face is their pronunciation.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware-installation-part">The Hardware Installation Part</h2>
<p>If you need to slide the block along a straight line, then I need to install the RFID Reader on the shelf. However, since we only have one Reader, I designed to install Reader on top of the shelf. This way, when the user places the block from the beginning, the scan action and process will not be realised.</p>
<p>I designed to paste the Reader and photon directly onto the shelf via the breadboard and use the power bank to provide power. The second way is to install the Reader on the shelf and then to solder some extensions to connect Photon to the power supply. This part will be decided after Alan connects to the game next week and projects it.</p>

<h2 id="the-exhibition-plan">The Exhibition Plan</h2>
<p>I designed the installation diagram in the field at The Edge. Although we changed to the infield part, we had more room to place the unit and place it on site. After confirming with Jason, I know that one side of our location will be a pedestrian passage, but it is still a semi-closed position. So, I decided to arrange the entire scene into a classroom scene. This also shows the main use Scenario of our concept - in the classroom. The specific layout is as follows:</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="5"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XXvbdMh.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>At the same time, I also divide the work of the team members to ensure that everyone can fully play their advantages. Davis will play the role of the teacher next to the Frame, teaching users how to pronounce and understand Korean. Alan will be responsible for and supervise all electronic equipment and ensure the operation of the program. Alison and I will be responsible for introducing Concept to Public and guiding visitors to sit down in the demo area. Korean language teaching is carried out by Davis.</p>
