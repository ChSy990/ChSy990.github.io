<p>Working in Process：Physical Materials<br>
These two weeks, Alison and I focused on the physical part and considered how to realize the installation. Because the team spent too much time in RFID, and it took about ten weeks to make the RFID part. Also, the entire RFID function cannot be implemented, or there will still be unrecognized problems. The RF interface is the most import part in the block. Therefore, Alison and I need to choose more materials for testing when considering the physical materials. We need to consider which materials are more comfortable to use when the entire device is installed. Alternatively, it does not block the radio frequency identification function during the transmission process.<br>
On the other hand, one of the essential parts of our physical prototype is block. After testing, our RFID has a limited RF range and distance, and the range of radiation can be within 5cm. At the same time, in the test, we found that there are some common materials, such as wood panels cannot be used because this material blocks the signal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the initial phase, our team's physical prototype originally planned to use lasers to cut small pieces of wood and install RFID tags inside them. However, after discussion and testing, the weight of the entire wood cube is too large. Moreover, its thickness hinders the transmission of radio frequency signals. In the end, Jason and Clay suggested that we use the laser to cut the board and cut the edges of the square board into irregular shapes. In this way, six square wooden boards can be joined into one square, and the weight can be effectively reduced. This hollow square is also very beneficial for us to put RFID tags on the inner side of the board.</p>

<p>The range of Our RFID Readers is limited, which caused our materials are limited. At the same time, we also need to have a lightweight, which is suitable for the user's hand movements. Alison and I chose many materials in Burnings and put the reader under the material for testing. From this test, we have a new understanding of the distance of wireless sensing that can be used in practice. After testing many materials, Alison and I chose three suitable methods and materials for the final comparison.</p>
<h2 id="1standard-mdf-panel-3mm6mm-the-best-choose">1.Standard MDF Panel （3mm/6mm--the best choose）</h2>
<p>MDF is an artificial board made of wood fibre or other plant fibre and used as an adhesive. After our test, when the RFID reader is attached under the board, the Tag can be identified 3cm away from the board. This is the best signal penetration material in our tests. Moreover, we can use a variety of materials to cover the surface of the board, and these materials can be glued to the surface of the board. Excellent physical properties, uniform material, no dehydration problem. This MDF has the strongest signal and is available in 3mm thickness. Therefore, we believe that this material is currently the most suitable.<br>

<h2 id="2particle-board-25mm">2.Particle Board (25mm)</h2>
<p>This material only recognizes signals in a 25mm style. However, the weight is relatively high, and the edge of the board is very easy to scratch people. So, Alison and I think that if we need to use this kind of sheet, then we need to cover the surface of the wood with a layer of cloth or material to prevent people from scratching. The problem is that if the material is covered on the surface, its weight becomes a burden. We think this wood can be used as an alternative to MDF because we need to pass the user test before we can choose the final interaction. The choice of wood board ultimately depends on how the user prefers to use it.</p>

<h2 id="3merch-pinethe-wood-block-30x30">3.Merch Pine（The wood block 30x30）</h2>
<p>This is a small square that has been cut, and, unexpectedly, it is much lighter than we expected. We envision that if we use this approach, we may not need to use laser cutting again. You can use the RFID tag directly on the surface of the small square. So this is also one of the alternatives to MDF.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="3"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hEW1dtO.png" alt=""></figure>
<h2 id="4other-materials">4.Other Materials</h2>
<p>Some of the materials I found in the 207 classrooms, such as some high-density compressed cardboard and lightweight materials. Includes some Velcro that can be used to cover the surface of small squares. Some small materials will help us in physical interactions.<br>

<p>After my discussion with Alison, we finally chose three ways and materials to make physical prototypes and small squares. We need to combine the cost to discuss with the other two team members before deciding which material to use. Because we need to combine the results of Davis's RFID work to determine the way materials are used. During the two-week material testing and search process, we found some essential materials and materials that we have never touched before. These necessary materials are constructive for our project and other projects. At the same time, by touching these things in the factory, I can also imagine the design of my physical interaction device. The whole process is fascinating. When I can't have the conceptual inspiration of the physical interaction part, I can choose to visit these material suppliers or sites like the Electron Core. It can give myself a lot of inspiration.</p>
