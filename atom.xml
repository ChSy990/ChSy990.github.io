<p>“Spoon Pets” is a conceptual interaction design of an application prototype that helps users develop productivity and overcome procrastination, therefore enables them to foster ethical behaviour. Spoon Pets is a mobile app that overcomes procrastination by allowing users to effectively manage their schedules and facilitating their use of the Pomodoro Technique to limit the use of mobile phones during their mission. Users can earn points by using the Pomodoro timer to complete tasks that can be used to raise virtual mobile pets. Whenever the points reach a certain amount, the app can donate a certain amount to non-profit organizations, allowing users to help stray animals in entertainment. The prototype was built by using Adobe suit and sketch.</p>
